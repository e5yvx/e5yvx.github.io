      <h1>How might we add <span class="highlight">"personalization"</span> to TrueChoice's Predictive HR App?</h1>
      <ul class="project-info">
        <li><b>Role: </b>Project lead, Manager</li>
        <li><b>Team: </b>4 Designers + Cross-department leads</li>
        <li><b>Tools used: </b>Photoshop, InVision</li>
        <li><b>Time frame: </b>2-week design sprint,  2020</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Role</h2>
      <p>
        I worked alongside 3 designers to experiment with new features intended to engage users and excite customers. I interviewed executive stakeholders and data scientists to define key objectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the manager of a small team that also supported client delivery and business development, I also helped to sort out incoming requests, prioritize work, and block out time for my team so they can make progress on this project. The overall success of this project is due to the flexibility, adaptiveness, and skill of my team.
      </p>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The challenge given were to weave in "personalization" and "conversational vibes" to TrueChoice's Predictive HR experience. At its genesis, this project was amorphous and we took many iterative turns to reach a suitable solution because we were given the opportunity to design <i>anything</i> that would, first, be visually striking in sales pitches to executive stakeholders and prospective customers, and secondly, be careful to avoid diluting the user experience or data granularity. The terms were up to us to interpret but overall, we wanted to create UI that visually departed from the original product we were pitching and also  add value for participants.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final proposal successfully offered a suite of eye-catching new changes that excited both existing and prospective customers while offering clear and valuable information to employees who would complete a study via the app. Due to the enhancements, our partners were more engaged in content development that benefited their participating employees.
      </p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <image alt="Image of 3-part app and TrueChoice logo"></image>
      <p>
        At TrueChoice, we build web apps that quantify user preferences and allow us to share quantifiable and actionable insights with our customers, most of whom are Fortune Global 500. The Predictive HR app is one of many offerings and helps an organization curate a more desirable Total Rewards package and save costs. It is segmented into 3 parts for each participating employee to learn, compare, and decide. At the end, we recommend next best actions according to their answers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 3-part methodology behind the app has been around since 2006 and the UI has been unchanged for over 12 years, even surviving it's translation from Flash to HTML 5 in 2014. Optically, this led to a decline in interest in our product as innovation was not perceived by prospective customers who already knew about or worked with TrueChoice.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project took place during the COVID-19 pandemic and our teams were completely remote and/or in different time zones. This was also the first time that some of us worked together at this scale due to recent hires and my push for meaningful communication and cross-team collaboration.
      </p>
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <h3>Discovery: Embracing Change and Ambiguity</h3>
      <image alt="Image of sketches"></image>
      <p>
        To start framing the goals for this project, I organized a brainstorm to gather perspectives and ideas from our analytics and technology teams before pitching a general direction back to executive stakeholders. Designers used the discussion notes and general direction to explore different solutions that we continuously refined between each other. Given the freedom and ambiguity, I periodically shared progress with the CEO which gave us the ability to continuously improve our understanding of the goals. I also checked in with the rest of technology team to ensure we can support a speedy implementation process.
      </p>
      <h3>Define, Ideate, Prototype: Crafting a Story</h3>
      <p>
        Balancing the two goals for this project was difficult. To meet the vanity goal, I facilitated a review of the many ideas generated by the team in the discovery phase where we picked out individual ideas that were both visually interesting and more importantly, could potentially improve each participant's experience. The suite of ideas became our proposal for the new Predictive HR app user experience.
      </p>
      <image alt="Image comparing part 1 UI"></image>
      <p>
        I has asked the team to focus on Part 1 ideas because it makes up about 50% of the user journey and would have the highest impact. The proposed concept is a careful assembly of unique ideas and intended to help participants provide better preference data.
      </p>
      <image alt="Image showing part 1 UI mockups"></image>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The most visually different is the layout of the iconography and slider handles. We felt this introduced to users a more direct way of interacting with each option. The new dynamic graph background also serves as a visual representation of their preferences and another opportunity for designers to use color.
        </li>
        <li>
          We added color coding to the sliders and numerical value displays. Originally, we also replaced the numerical values with descriptive text but user testing showed confusion and this idea was scrapped before final implementation. The forethought with this change is the departure from sprite-based assets to CSS-based UI, which would improve browser performance and reduce steps in the build process.
        </li>
        <li>
          The larger image on the desktop layout also supports a "dynamic speech bubble" which can be used for words of encouragement after every few pages (we often had 18 pages in part 1, albeit otherwise advice) or used for "fun facts" relevant to the app's subject matter.
        </li>
        <li>
          We also created an onboarding animation for the slider. This helped me convince our delivery team to be more comfortable with removing the redundant instructions from the pages.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <image alt="Image comparing output UI"></image>
      <p>
        When each participant completes the application, they are greeted with the output page. Our new output page surfaces relevant and useful information and action to each participant.
      </p>
      <image alt="Image showing output UI sections"></image>
      <ol>
        <li>
          We removed the static images which seldom matched the dynamic messages and caused confusion according to past client projects and user testing.
        </li>
        <li>
          We added the ability to show more than 3 dynamically relevant messages (according to each participant's preferences) and added CTA buttons to each message. The new buttons are intended to encourage relevant action and we hope to see a higher engagement rate in future project. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Working with the analytics team, we added "bucketed preference groups" that gave participants more colorful insight into their how their preferences compared to their coworkers. This feature was especially exciting to our partners as it offered new possibilities for displaying data to their users. 
        </li>
        <li>
          There is also an option to "save" the output page as a PDF, allowing interested participants to download their results for later use. We can't expect our users to engage with the app for an extended period of time so we hope this would provide a useful option.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        To complete the list of enhancements, we went back to the delivery team to help establish a consistent writing style that was slightly more conversational and relaxed. We also removed any lingo or jargon specific to TrueChoice as all our expected users will be first time participants.
      </p>
      <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
      <p>
        Given the sheer amount of changes, I worked with our director of technology to immediately set up a highly functional usability test. Our design proposal was sensitive to subtle interactions quirks and other forms of prototyping were not suitable. 
      </p>
      <h3>Revisiting</h3>
      <p>
        In our 2-week design sprint, we decided to table some considerations in order to deliver a full suite of changes rather than individual and complete features. We revisited the features which included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Designing for the use cases supported in the new output layout. For example, each message must have a CTA button but not every project will be able to provide links for every message.
        </li>
        <li>
          Updating Part 2 and Part 3 sliders as CSS-based components. When we rebuilt Part 1 sliders with CSS, the designs no longer matched those still built with sprite assets.
        </li>
        <li>
          I also wrote new requirements with a developer to scale up the PDF printing feature. The original implementation required a developer to be on standby and configure the page based on the amount of content. The new implementation is print-friendly and removed any setup time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <image alt="Add testimonials"></image>
      <p>
        The suite of enhancements are used in all our sales pitch mockups. Anecdotally, we received applause and excitement from our CEO, our organization partners, our sales team, and the customers signing on with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within active projects, the associates we work with are excited about the new capabilities shown in the output page and have followed our guidance to share information and actions to their users. We do not have conclusive usage statistics on the changes to Part 1 yet but is so far showing positive outcome.
