      <h1>How might we add <span class="highlight">"personalization"</span> to TrueChoice's Predictive HR App?</h1>
      <ul class="project-info">
        <li><b>Role: </b>Project lead, Manager</li>
        <li><b>Team: </b>4 Designers</li>
        <li><b>Tools used: </b>Photoshop, InVision</li>
        <li><b>Year: </b>2020</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Role</h2>
      <p>
        I worked alongside 3 designers to experiment with new features intended to engage users and excite customers. I interviewed ideas from executive stakeholders and data scientists to define key objectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the manager of a small team that also supported client delivery and business development, I also had to help sort out, prioritize, and block out time for my team so they can make progress on this project. Regardless, the success of this project is due to the flexibility, adaptiveness, and skill of my team.
      </p>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The vision bestowed to us were to weave more "personalization" and "conversational vibes" to the Predictive HR experience. At its genesis, this project was amorphous and we took many iterative turns to reach a suitable solution because we were given the freedom to design <i>anything</i> that would first be visually appealing to executive stakeholders, and secondly we were careful to avoid diluting the user experience or data granularity. The terms were up to us to interpret but overall, we wanted to create UI that visually departed from the original and would be meaningful to participants.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final proposal successfully offered a suite of eye-catching new changes that excited both existing and prospective customers while offering clear and valuable information to employees who would complete a study via the app. Due to the improved output page, our partners were more engaged in content development that benefited the end users.
      </p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        At TrueChoice, we build web apps that quantify user preferences and allows us to share quantifiable and actionable insights with our customers, most of whom are Fortune Global 500. The Predictive HR app is one of many offerings and helps an organization curate a more desirable Total Rewards package and save costs. It is segmented into 3 parts for each participating employee to learn, compare, and decide. At the end, we recommend next best actions according to their answers.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project took place during the COVID-19 pandemic and our teams were completely remote and/or in different time zones. This was also the first time that some of us worked together at this scale due to recent hires and my push for meaningful communication and cross-team collaboration.
      </p>
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <h3>Discovery: Embracing Change and Ambiguity</h3>
      <image alt="Image of 3-part app"></image>
      <p>
        The 3-part methodology behind the app has been around since 2006 and the UI has been unchanged for over 12 years, even surviving it's translation from Flash to HTML 5 in 2014.
      </p>
      <image alt="Image of sketches"></image>
      <p>
        To start framing the goals for this project, I organized a brainstorm to gather perspectives and ideas from our analytics and technology teams. Designers used the discussion notes to explore different solutions that we continuously refined between each other. We were allowed to work on any part of the app. Given the freedom and ambiguity, we periodically looped in the CEO and the rest of technology team.
      </p>
      <h3>Define, Ideate, Prototype: Crafting a Story</h3>
      <p>
        To meet the vanity goal, the team generated a different ideas in their visual exploration. Then we chose ideas that were not only visually interesting but could potentially improve each participant's experience. The suite of ideas became our proposal for the "new Predictive HR app".
      </p>
      <image alt="Image comparing part 1 UI"></image>
      <p>
        Our new interface for Part 1 is intended to help participants better differentiate between options.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          We added color coding to the sliders and numerical value displays that change relative to the input. Originally, we also replaced the numerical values with descriptive text but user testing showed confusion and this idea was scrapped before final implementation.
        </li>
        <li>
          We introduced a dynamic graph background as a another visual representation of the comparison between options.
        </li>
        <li>
          The larger image on the desktop layout also supports a "dynamic speech bubble" which can be used for words of encouragement after every few pages (we sometimes had 18 pages in part 1, albeit unadvised) or "fun facts" relevant to the app's subject matter.
        </li>
        <li>
          For fun, we also created an animation for the slider. This feature helped me convince our delivery to be more comfortable with removing the redundant instructions from the pages.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <image alt="Image comparing output UI"></image>
      <p>
        When each participant completes the application, they are greeted with the output page. Our new output page surfaces relevant and useful information and action to each participant.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          We removed the static images which seldom matched the dynamic messages and caused confusion according to past client projects and user testing.
        </li>
        <li>
          We added the ability to show more than 3 dynamically relevant messages (according to each participant's preferences) and added CTA buttons to each message. The new buttons are intended to encourage relevant action and we hope to see a higher engagement rate in future project. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The biggest change is the addition of "bucketed preference groups". 
        </li>
        <li>
          There is also an option to "save" the output page as a PDF, allowing interested participants to download their results for later use. We can't expect our users to engage with the app for an extended period of time so we hope this would provide a useful option.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        To complete the list of enhancements, we went back to the client delivery team to establish a writing style that was slightly more conversational and relaxed. We also removed any lingo or jargon specific to TrueChoice as all our expected users will be first time participants.
      </p>
      <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
      <p>
        Given the sheer amount of changes, we worked with our dev team to immediately set up a highly functional usability test. Our design proposal was sensitive to subtle interactions quirks and other forms of prototyping were not suitable. 
      </p>
      <h3>Revisiting</h3>
      <p>
        In our design sprint to create a suite of features, we decided to table some considerations for some of the features. We will need to revisit these features. The follow ups include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Output messages must have a CTA button but not every project will be able to provide links for every message.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now that Part 1 sliders are built with CSS, it might no longer match Part 2 and Part 3 sliders that are built with sprite assets.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        The suite of enhancements received applause and excitement from our CEO and customers. We do not have conclusive usage statistics on the changes to Part 1 yet and we're excited to check back but overall reactions are positive. The associates we work with are excited about the capabilities shown in the output page and have shared ideas about the types of information or actions we might be able to surface to their users.
