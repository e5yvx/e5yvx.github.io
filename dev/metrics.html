        <h2>Role</h2>
        <p>
          As the design lead of a budding product team, I introduced a series of standards, tools, and processes that became the framework for a user centric technology team.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          At TrueChoice, we build web apps that quantify user preferences and allow us to share quantifiable and actionable insights with our customers. The design process for each project was 2-3 weeks of drawing and pitching multiple design concepts that reinterpreted the client’s branding. The UI, the fonts, and the layout were moved around in order to add to the diversity of each concept.
        </p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          In 2014, when we started to transition the technology from from Flash to HTML5, I took the opportunity to address scalability in our creative process by establishing a standard UI template that followed usability heuristics. This was a catalyst into more user-centric design processes, research, and user testing. A year later, we decreased the creative process for each client from 3 weeks to a few days — and by 2020, to only a few hours. The time saved was invested into our new design values centered around identifying and solving problems for our users, and helps move TrueChoice’s products forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          The phases follow my growth as a designer and maturity into a ux leader at TrueChoice:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Phase 1: Establishing Fundamentals</b>
            <ol>
              <li>
                I evangelized a base user-centric design process compiled of usability heuristics and research-backed decisions while designing the first iteration of the app.
              </li>
              <li>
                I started usability tests with the internal team. In the early stage, this was enough to collect feedback and make discoveries for improvement.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Phase 2: Tracking Metrics & Knowledge Share.</b>
            <ol>
              <li>
                I reached out to the development team to install UX Metrics that helped track real usage data. The metrics were used to track and confirm successes. They were also used to help gather executive buy-in on areas of improvement.
              </li>
              <li>
                In addition, my team maintained a set of documentation and training processes to pass on our learnings to future designers.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Phase 3: User Research & Next Steps</b>
            <ol>
              <li>
                I reached out to our COO and CEO to set up a process and budget for usability testing outside of the company. I set up NDA forms before reaching out to “friends of the firm” for the first few rounds of testing, and then finally set up a budget for more testers who are key in ensuring regular tests. We documented our findings and held organization-wide debriefings summarizing the takeaways.
              </li>
              <li>
                During the 2020 pandemic, we started remote testing sessions. We hope to leave an archive of recordings for future designers and researchers at TrueChoice. 
              </li>
              <li>
                As a leader, I work with our executive stakeholders to determine key strategic goals for company. I help define and set the vision for TrueChoice’s product offerings: Predictive HR, Predictive Selling, and more.

        <h2>Phase 1</h2>
        <h3>Practicing User-centric Design</h3>
        <p>
          My first iteration of the redesigned HTML5 application in 2014 applied usability heuristics that were already researched and established by the UX industry. I documented best practices and presented my findings to the product team. I also guided the team via review and feedback.

        <p>
          - part of the established a process of internal testing, then external testing
        </p>
        
          - introduced usage tracking and metrics
          - later, an iterative process of micro and macro improvement thru usability testing and metrics
          - at first, I trained other designers and developers thru guidance and feedback, and later, thru reports, guides, and templates
          - The framework reduced time spent redesigning layout from weeks to hours, increased the number of meaningful improvements that are rolled out each week, and set up metrics to monitor OKRs.

        <h3>Adding Metrics</h3>
        <h3>Creating Tools</h3>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          This is an ongoing journey. There are more capabilities I hope to help TrueChoice build before I can call my team a real product team but we're getting really close! Some of our major wins include:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Reduced valuable time (re)designing and (re)building parts of the app that won't move the product forward. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Identified new areas of opportunity and user pain points. From our research, we were able to discover and prioritize work that matters.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gained stakeholder buy-in by building the design team’s credibility and ability to measure successes.
          </li>
        </ol>
