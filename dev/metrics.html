        <h2>Role</h2>
        <p>
          As the design lead of a budding product team, I introduced a series of standards, tools, and processes that became the framework for a user centric technology team.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          At TrueChoice, we build web apps that quantify user preferences and allow us to share quantifiable and actionable insights with our customers. The design process for each project was 2-3 weeks of drawing and pitching multiple design concepts that reinterpreted the client’s branding. The UI, the fonts, and the layout were moved around in order to add to the diversity of each concept. Development was another 1-2 weeks.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          In 2014, when we started to transition the technology from from Flash to HTML5, I took the opportunity to address scalability in our delivery process by establishing a standard UI template that followed usability heuristics. This was a catalyst into more user-centric design processes, research, and user testing. A year later, we decreased the delivery process for each client from 4 weeks to a few days — and by 2020, to only a few hours. The time saved was invested into our new design values centered around identifying and solving problems for our users, and helps move TrueChoice’s products forward.

        <p>
          The phases follow my growth as a designer and maturity into a ux leader at TrueChoice:

            <b>Phase 1: Establishing Fundamentals</b>
            <ol>
              <li>
                I evangelized a base user-centric design process compiled of usability heuristics and research-backed decisions while designing the first iteration of the app.
              </li>
              <li>
                I started usability tests with the internal team. In the early stage, this was enough to collect feedback and make discoveries for improvement.

            <b>Phase 2: Tracking Metrics & Knowledge Share</b>
            <ol>
              <li>
                I reached out to the development team to install UX Metrics that helped track real usage data. The metrics were used to track and confirm successes. They were also used to help gather executive buy-in on areas of improvement.
              </li>
              <li>
                In addition, my team maintained a set of documentation and training processes to pass on our learnings to future designers.

            <b>Phase 3: User Research & Next Steps</b>
            <ol>
              <li>
                I reached out to our COO and CEO to set up a process and budget for usability testing outside of the company. I set up NDA forms before reaching out to “friends of the firm” for the first few rounds of testing, and then finally set up a budget for more testers who are key in ensuring regular tests. We documented our findings and held organization-wide debriefings summarizing the takeaways.
              </li>
              <li>
                During the 2020 pandemic, we started remote testing sessions. We hope to leave an archive of recordings for future designers and researchers at TrueChoice. 
              </li>
              <li>
                As a leader, I work with our executive stakeholders to determine key strategic goals for company. I help define and set the vision for TrueChoice’s product offerings: Predictive HR, Predictive Selling, and more.

        <h2>Phase 1: Establishing Fundamentals</h2>
        <h3>Practicing User-centric Design</h3>
        <p>
          My first iteration of the redesigned HTML5 application in 2014 applied usability heuristics that were already researched and established. I gathered research findings from <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/" target="_blank">Neilsen Norman Group</a> and <a href="https://baymard.com/" target="_blank">Baymard Institute</a>, and best practices from web articles and books like Steve Krug's <i>Don't Make Me Think</i>. Apple and Google were also publishing <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/" target="_blank">UI guidelines</a> that we were able to borrow from. 
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img alt="Flash UI next to it’s new web-responsive incarnation">
        </figure>
        <p>
          Since most of the user research was already done, I approached the recreation of the original Flash UI like a model kit where I was simply putting the pieces together. From the research, we knew buttons and fonts had to be a certain size. When setting the scope with the VP of Tech, we knew certain customizations and flairs like font families and animations were going to come later. Our prime focus was on the usability and so the fun part was designing the responsive UI. None of the parts fit on the popular 320px wide iPhone. (<i>Don't worry Android fans, we also looked at and tested on non-Apple devices.</i>)
        </p>
        <h3>Rapid Prototyping and Internal Usability Testing</h3>
        <figure>
          <img alt="Devices laid out for an organizational-wide unveiling and testing">
        </figure>
        <p>
          At first, we waited until after a beta version was developed before I could test it with teammates who did not directly work on the project. Part of the reason was to maintain a grand unveiling to build excitement within the organization. While we did receive a lot of excitement and praise, we learned that this was a mistake because this first iteration took us weeks to build and did not meet all the requirements of our analytics team. From then on, we interviewed representatives from each department for key requirements. The remaining modicum of secrecy was to maintain testers. I didn't understand until later but we didn't reach out to users because we weren't allowed direct access to the participants who use our app, nor testing candidates because there were concerns of leaking sensitive IP.
        </p>

        <p>
          These rugged usability tests were excellent for collecting feedback and discovering opportunities for improvement, however, we were still working with developers to implement and I needed to get my ideas in front of people quicker. InVision was only a few years old at this time and their product was helpful for plugging in our wireframes for quick tests and demos. I also tried POP by Marvel as an even quicker way to turn paper drawings into a prototype. Very soon, rapid prototyping became an integral part of an iterative process that allowed us to make mistakes and validate faster.

        <h2>Phase 2: Tracking Metrics & Knowledge Share</h2>
        <h3>Adding Metrics</h3>
        - introduced usage tracking and metrics
        - later, an iterative process of micro and macro improvement thru usability testing and metrics
        - at first, I trained other designers and developers thru guidance and feedback, and later, thru reports, guides, and templates
        - The framework reduced time spent redesigning layout from weeks to hours, increased the number of meaningful improvements that are rolled out each week, and set up metrics to monitor OKRs. 
        <h3>Knowledge Share</h3>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          This is an ongoing journey. There are more capabilities I hope to help TrueChoice build before I can call my team a real product team but we're getting really close! Some of our major wins include:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Reduced valuable time (re)designing and (re)building parts of the app that won't move the product forward. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Identified new areas of opportunity and user pain points. From our research, we were able to discover and prioritize work that matters.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gained stakeholder buy-in by building the design team’s credibility and ability to measure successes.
          </li>
        </ol>
