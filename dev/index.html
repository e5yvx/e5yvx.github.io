      <p>
        I am the lead designer and manager of the multi-disciplinary design team at&#160;<a href="https://www.truechoice.io/">TrueChoice</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There, I have the pleasure of sharing my experiences in <span class="highlight">digital interaction, user experience, and creative direction</span> with talented designers and developers in order to deliver innovative solutions that are useful to our&#160;customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        My repertoire include designing responsive and globally deployed applications, evangelizing design thinking and research, recruiting designers, and developing strategies and internal tools for scaling up cross-functional&#160;teams.
