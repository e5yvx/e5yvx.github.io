      <h1>Kelvin K Lok. Designer. Manager.</h1>
      <p>
        I am the lead designer and manager of a multi-disciplinary design team at&#160;<a href="https://www.truechoice.io/">TrueChoice</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There, I have the pleasure of sharing my experiences in digital interactions, user experience, and creative direction with talented designers and developers in order to deliver innovative solutions that are useful to our&#160;customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        My repertoire include globally deploying applications, evangelizing design thinking and research, recruiting designers, and developing strategies and internal products for scaling up cross-functional&#160;teams.
