        <h2>Role</h2>
        <p>
          I redesigned the product recommendation page for TrueChoice's <i>Predictive Selling</i> app to increase conversion rates. I was the sole designer who researched, defined the core challenges, and explored different solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project was balanced with responsibilities across client delivery and business development. I reported directly to the VP of Technology who lead the product team.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          The product recommendation page is the grand finale to TrueChoice's <i>Predictive Selling</i> app. This app is one of TrueChoice's many offerings and helps B2C or B2B2C organizations recommend products and/or services that best fit a user's preferences and needs. It is segmented into 3 parts for users to learn, compare, and decide so they may be more likely to make an educated purchase. It is important for the app and this page in particular to promote the client and have a high conversion rate.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          I redesigned the product recommendation page for TrueChoice's <i>Predictive Selling</i> app to increase conversion rates. I used the 5-stage design thinking process to reach my final proposal — empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test.

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <h3>Empathize</h3>
        <figure>
          <img alt="Before the redesign">
        </figure>
        <p>
          I needed to understand what the redesign should achieve. I did not have direct access to users and instead, I facilitated a brainstorm with our delivery team who worked with our partners who had access to users. I also interviewed our CEO who was leading BizDev to gather what we knew about. To summarize, the potential challenges included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It is not clear where respondents should focus. There is competition be visual elements on the page. For example, we placed icons next to the product image
          </li>
          <li>
            Not visually engaging
            Not clear for respondents which actions to take
            CTAs risk being pushed below the fold due to long copy elements
            CTAs are too narrow for text on mobile
          </li>
          <li>
            All copy elements have the same weight
            The ‘thank you’ text is larger and thus seems more important than the product title
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Observing Industry Practices</h3>
        <figure>
          <img alt="Before the redesign">
        </figure>
        <p>
          Next, I examined over 24 websites to look for patterns. Some of the notable observations were:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Majority of sites placed the CTAs above product details and description
          </li>
          <li>
            Majority of sites were two columns
            Product title and CTAs are placed on the right side of the product image
          </li>
          <li>
            Insight into hierarchy
            Product title and CTA are most important
            Price is as important as the product title
          </li>
          <li>
            Majority of upsell options were below the main product’s details
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Define</h3>
        <p>
          CORE OBJECTIVES
          Create a visually engaging product recommendation display that is easier for the eye to navigate, absorb, and comprehend.

          Help facilitate respondent's 'call to action' -- the ultimate driver of return on investment for a client. 

          Develop an approach that is adaptable to and equally effective for both PC and mobile form-factors.

          Apply cutting edge design strategies, tools and approaches based in part on a comprehensive review of current 'best practices' and trends. 

          Retain flexibility to apply a range of creative options and branding styles and also to cater to custom client direction and requirements. 

          Prominently retain the 'personalization' tools and visuals that reinforce TrueChoice's core capabilities, uniqueness and efficacy.
