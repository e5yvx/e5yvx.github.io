        <h2>Role</h2>
        <p>
          I redesigned the product recommendation page for TrueChoice's <i>Predictive Selling</i> app to increase conversion rates. I was the sole designer who researched, defined the core challenges, and explored different solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project was balanced with responsibilities across client delivery and business development. I reported directly to the VP of Technology who led the product team.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          The product recommendation page is the grand finale to TrueChoice's <i>Predictive Selling</i> app. This app is one of TrueChoice's many offerings to help B2C or B2B2C organizations recommend products and/or services that best fit a user's preferences and needs. It is segmented into 3 parts for users to learn, compare, and decide so they may feel more confident and become more likely to make a purchase. The page promoted the client's products and services and allowed users to learn more about or purchase the client's product or services. The app supported a diverse range of use cases, for example, healthcare & insurance, computer products, and telecom bundles. Overall as a sales support tool, a high conversion rate was critical to its success. However, after a poor performance, the c-suite wanted me to propose improvements.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          I redesigned the product recommendation page for TrueChoice's <i>Predictive Selling</i> app to increase conversion rates. This project took me through most of the design process — empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. I worked around restricted interactions with users by interviewing those who did, and a lack of usability testing by following UX conventions.
        </p>
        <p>
          While imperfect, this was one of my favorite projects at TrueChoice because it was a milestone showing the thought leadership and designing thinking that the product team could provide to the organization moving forward. Future projects were more efficient than 6 weeks and had less red tape to maneuver around.
        </p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <h3>Empathize</h3>
        <figure>
          <img src="./assets/product-composite-current.png" alt="Before the redesign">
          <figcaption>Before the redesign</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          I needed to understand what the redesign should achieve. I did not have direct access to users and instead, I facilitated an interview with our delivery team who worked with our partners who had access to users. I also interviewed our CEO who was leading BizDev, and I looked at current and past implementation. To summarize, the potential challenges include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It is not clear where respondents should focus or which actions to take. There is competition be visual elements on the page. For example, we typically placed icons next to the product image.
          </li>
          <li> 
            With dynamic content, primary buttons risk being pushed below the fold. Also, the 2-column of buttons was too narrow for text on a mobile device.
          </li>
          <li>
            The text hierarchy was flat and incorrect. For example, the “thank you” text is larger and seemed more important than the product title.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I had also enumerated a list of required components based on TrueChoice's past projects. TrueChoice's unique offerings were visualized through what we called the <i>Preference Profile</i> and <i>Personalized Messages</i>. In my interview with the CEO, I knew they had to be included at the top of the page too.
        </p>

          <figcaption>Over 24 consumer websites examined</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          I noticed this feature had many parallels with conventional consumer product pages. I examined a variety of industries because TrueChoice's <i>Predictive Selling</i> app could be adapted to any B2B or B2B2C use case. Over 24 websites were cross-examined for patterns including Adidas, Amazon, American Express, Dell, Geico, and more. Some of the notable observations were:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A majority of sites placed their “Buy” button above the product description and specifications.
          <li>
            A majority of layouts were split into two columns when space allowed. The product title and buttons are placed on the right side of the large product image, above the fold.
          </li>
          <li>
            Based on these observations, I could extract the general hierarchy for the components on the page. The product title, price, and “Buy” button are most important.
          </li>
          <li>
            A majority of sites also included upsell options below the main product’s details.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Define</h3>
        <p>
          Now that I had a sense of where our original implementation misaligned with feedback and industry conventions, I could start defining the project's objectives:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Create a visually engaging product recommendation display that is easier for the eye to navigate, absorb, and comprehend. Since we didn't have the means to run usability tests, we can borrow from industry conventions and trends.
          </li>
          <li>
            Better facilitate a user's ability to buy — the ultimate driver of return on investment for a client. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Retain flexibility to apply a range of creative options, branding styles, and also cater to custom client direction and requirements. This was important to TrueChoice because our sales pipeline was industry diverse. It was expected that we would revisit the design when industry-specific requirements arise.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prominently retain the 'personalization' tools and visuals that reinforce TrueChoice's core capabilities, uniqueness, and efficacy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Develop an approach that is adaptable to and equally effective for both PC and mobile form factors.
          </li>
        </ol>        
        <h3>Ideate</h3>
        <p>
          I must have exported over 400 JPGs before refining it into 1 cohesive set. While I had a good idea of what the general solution should look like, I was struggling with balancing and getting approval for the layout of TrueChoice's unique offerings with the consumer goals, which were both equally important according to stakeholders. The approved proposed hid the <i>Preference Profile</i> and <i>Personalized Messages</i> away in a drawer button. I convinced stakeholders by suggesting that this would limit distractions on the page and divert more users to the “Buy” button — and that we will track the usage of the button after launch. (This was before we facilitated usability tests.)
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./assets/product-rejected-concepts.png" alt="Rejected wireframes">
          <figcaption>Rejected wireframes</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          This feature had a long list of use cases we wanted to be ready to potentially use it for. I included wireframes showing how the drawer feature would slides out and different configurations of optional components like data tables, image carousel, upsell cards, and additional buttons. I also tested the layout with various amounts of content and different languages. In addition, responsive design was new to the team and so I also made sure to wireframe how the layout responded at incremental breakpoints from desktop to mobile. I learned later that if I had narrowed down the scope with the project lead, I could have spent less time ideating and had a prototype much quicker. 
        </p>

        </figure>
        <h3>Prototype</h3>
        <p>
          Besides the different configurations and global content support, there were 2 other important details to ensure.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The product image, title, and “Buy” button had to be above the fold. Hence my prototypes for this feature were only device mockups on an iPad and using guides in Photoshop to measure how much content fits on the screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            Our delivery team needed to be able to brand the layout for different clients. I showed the team how this layout could be applied. These examples are not TrueChoice clients.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Test</h3>
        <p>
          In lieu of access to users and usability tests at this time, I worked with the development team to add tracking to the buttons. We tracked interaction and conversion rates for the ambivalent drawer button and the “Buy” button's new position. Unfortunately, we did not already have tracking in the previous implementation and could not determine if this iteration was an improvement. However, I was still glad to have added tracking for future iterations. We also extracted confidence from how similar the new layout was to already established industry conventions.

        <h2>Results</h2>

        </figure>
        <p>
          This new feature was crucial in winning a project with ENI, an Italian multinational oil and gas company that is considered one of the seven “supermajor” oil companies in the world. The “Predictive Selling” app was launched in their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ2ZIVYxksA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017 campaign</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tangentially, the new tracking capabilities created baseline data to track the performance of the “Predictive Selling” offering. The process I followed was also an excellent training example for the rest of the team who were new to the design process, who later improved upon my process and made it more efficient. While this project took 6 weeks, the trust and rapport I built with the executive stakeholders helped expedite future approval steps. Ultimately, this project was a milestone showing the thought leadership and design thinking that the product team could provide to the organization moving forward.
