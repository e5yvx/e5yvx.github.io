        <h2>Role</h2>
        <p>
          I redesigned the product recommendation page for TrueChoice's <i>Predictive Selling</i> app to increase conversion rates. I was the sole designer who researched, defined the core challenges, and explored different solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project was balanced with responsibilities across client delivery and business development. I reported directly to the VP of Technology who lead the product team.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          The product recommendation page is the grand finale to TrueChoice's <i>Predictive Selling</i> app. This app is one of TrueChoice's many offerings and helps B2C or B2B2C organizations recommend products and/or services that best fit a user's preferences and needs. It is segmented into 3 parts for users to learn, compare, and decide so they may be more likely to make an educated purchase. It is important for the app and this page in particular to promote the client and have a high conversion rate.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          I redesigned the product recommendation page for TrueChoice's <i>Predictive Selling</i> app to increase conversion rates. I used the 5-stage design thinking process to reach my final proposal — empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test.

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <h3>Empathize</h3>

          <img alt="Before the redesign">
        </figure>
        <p>
          I needed to understand what the redesign should achieve. I did not have direct access to users and instead, I facilitated a brainstorm with our delivery team who worked with our partners who had access to users. I also interviewed our CEO who was leading BizDev, and I looked at current and past implementation. To summarize, the potential challenges included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It is not clear where respondents should focus. There is competition be visual elements on the page. For example, we typically placed icons next to the product image.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not visually engaging
            Not clear for respondents which actions to take
            CTAs risk being pushed below the fold due to long copy
            CTAs are too narrow for text on mobile
          </li>
          <li>
            All copy elements have the same weight
            The ‘thank you’ text is larger and thus seems more important than the product title
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I had also enumerated a list of required components based on TrueChoice's past projects. TrueChoice's unique offerings were visualized through what we called the <i>Preference Profile</i> and <i>Personalized Messages</i>. In my interview with the CEO, I knew these had to be included at the top of the page too.
        </p>

        <p>
          I noticed this feature had many parallels with conventional consumer product pages. I examined a variety of industries because TrueChoice's <i>Predictive Selling</i> app could be adapted to any B2B or B2B2C use case. Over 24 websites were cross-examined for patterns including Adidas, Amazon, American Express, Dell, Geico, and more. Some of the notable observations were:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A majority of sites placed their “Buy” button above the product description and specifications.
          <li>
            A majority of layouts were spilt into two columns when space allowed. The product title and buttons are placed on the right side of the large product image, above the fold.
          </li>
          <li>
            Based on these observations, I could extract the general hierarchy for the components on the page. The product title, price and “Buy” button are most important.
          </li>
          <li>
            A majority of sites also included upsell options below the main product’s details.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Define</h3>
        <p>
          Now that I had a sense of where TrueChoice's implementation misaligned with industry conventions, I could start defining the project's objectives:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Create a visually engaging product recommendation display that is easier for the eye to navigate, absorb, and comprehend. Since we didn't have the means to run usability tests, we can borrow from industry conventions and trends.
          </li>
          <li>
            Better facilitate a user's ability to buy — the ultimate driver of return on investment for a client. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Retain flexibility to apply a range of creative options, branding styles, and also cater to custom client direction and requirements. This was important to TrueChoice because our sales pipeline was industry diverse. It was expected that we would revisit the design when industry-specific requirements arise.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prominently retain the 'personalization' tools and visuals that reinforce TrueChoice's core capabilities, uniqueness and efficacy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Develop an approach that is adaptable to and equally effective for both PC and mobile form factors.
          </li>
        </ul>
